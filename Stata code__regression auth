/*******************************************************************************
* Do-file: New Models with Pooling and Delegation as Outcomes
*
* Objective: To test a series of hypotheses about the determinants of
* pooling and delegation, moderated by politicization, democratic
* membership, and the proportion of central bankers.
*
* 
*******************************************************************************/


clear all

* This loads  specific dataset.
use "tgn_memb_gran.dta"

* --- DEFINE KEY VARIABLE NAME ---
* IMPORTANT: Check that the variable name in the quotes below EXACTLY matches
* the name of the "proportion of central bankers" variable in dataset.
local pcb_var "Proportion_Central_Bankers"


capture confirm variable `pcb_var'
if _rc != 0 {
    display as error "ERROR: The variable '`pcb_var'' was not found in your dataset."
    display as error "Please correct the variable name in the local macro 'pcb_var' and re-run the script."
    exit 111
}

* --- DATA PREPARATION & LABELING ---
label variable dem_gov_score "Democratic Governance Score"
label variable politicization_score_sqrt "Politicization Score"
label variable delegation_score "Delegation Score"
label variable pooling_score "Pooling Score"
label variable membership_dem_score "Democratic Membership Score"
label variable `pcb_var' "Proportion of Central Bankers"

* Encode string variables for use in models
encode network, generate(network_id_numeric)
encode region, generate(region_numeric)
encode membership_type, generate(membership_type_numeric)

* Apply value labels for clear plotting
label define region_lbl 1 "Global" 2 "European"
label values region_numeric region_lbl
label define memtype_lbl 1 "Central Bank" 2 "Regulator / Mixed"
label values membership_type_numeric memtype_lbl


* Define a set of base control variables
global base_controls "i.region_numeric"
